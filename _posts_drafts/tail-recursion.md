Tail recursion is a specific form of recursion in computer programming where a function calls itself as its last action before returning a result. In other words, in a tail-recursive function, the recursive call is the last operation performed within the function, and the result of that call is immediately returned without any further computation.

The key characteristic of tail recursion is that it doesn't require the caller function to do any additional work after receiving the result of the recursive call. This property allows some programming languages and compilers to optimize tail-recursive functions to avoid consuming additional stack space for each recursive call, making them more memory-efficient and potentially avoiding stack overflow errors.

Here's an example of a tail-recursive function in Python that calculates the factorial of a number:

python

def tail_recursive_factorial(n, accumulator=1):
    if n == 0:
        return accumulator
    else:
        return tail_recursive_factorial(n - 1, n * accumulator)

In this example, the tail_recursive_factorial function calculates the factorial of a number n using a tail-recursive approach. It uses an accumulator (accumulator) to accumulate the result, and the recursive call tail_recursive_factorial(n - 1, n * accumulator) is the last operation before returning the final result.

Tail recursion is particularly useful in functional programming languages and in situations where optimization for tail calls is supported by the language or compiler.     Some programming languages and compilers recognize tail recursion and perform optimization, such as TCO (tail call optimization), which can significantly improve the performance of tail-recursive functions. This means that tail recursion isn't just a matter of coding style; it can have a direct impact on the efficiency of your code.

## How TCO works

Compilers often use a stack to manage data local to the scope of the function. One stack frame holds all the necessary details of that scope, like parameter values and local variables inside the function. It also has bookkeeping data to restore the callers state after returning from the function, such as the return address for the caller's code and callee-saved registers (that need to be restored because the callee will use these registers and thus overwrite the CPU state of the calling environment). When the function is called, its information is put on the stack, and when the function finishes, the stack is popped: all data has gone out of scope and will not be accessed anymore anyway.

For each recursive call, we would normally push a new frame onto the stack.  For non-tail-recursive functions, the stack can get quite deep, meaning it uses more memory. Some code safety 

To optimize tail-recursive functions, compilers do something simple: because the recursive call is the last thing that happens, there's no need to keep the current function's stack data because it won't be used anymore.

It's important to note that not all programming languages and compilers support tail call optimization, and the extent of optimization may vary. Programmers should be aware of their programming environment's capabilities when considering tail recursion.
