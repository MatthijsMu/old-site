##### Structures and interpretation


Structures are also a way of showing that a choice of axioms in a theory $$T$$ does not always uniquely determine the truth of other logical sentences. For example, the theory $$T_{ring}$$ of rings, written in the language $$L_{ring}$$ of *rings*, has many models, some of which but not all of which are commutative rings, that is, that model the additional sentence $$

##### Tarski's definition of truth

The development of model theory is for a 

It turns out that Tarski's definition of truth of logical sentences in structures follows the same semantics that we are used to in our day-to-day reasoning
