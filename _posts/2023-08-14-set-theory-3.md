## Functions

A function can now be defined as follows:

> **Function** A function $$f : A\rightarrow B$$ is a relation $$f\subset A\times B$$ such that 
> *For all* $$ x \in A$$ *!Exists* $$y \in Y$$ $$xfy$$

We just introduced a new shorthand notation, which I shall define:

> - ($$!Exists y \in Y$$ $$\varphi$$) *iff.* ($$!Exists y$$ ($$y \in Y$$ *and* $$\varphi$$))
> - ($$!Exists y$$ $$\psi$$) *iff.* (($$Exists y$$ $$\psi$$) *and* (*For all* z ($$\varphi[z/y]$$ *iff.* $$z=y$$))

That means, the $$y$$ satisfying $$xfy$$ is unique for every $$x$$.

## Axiom of replacement

Suppose we have a well-formed formula $$\varphi(x,y)$$ that only has free variables $$x$$ and $$y$$, such that for all sets $$a$$, there is at most one set $$b$$ for which $$\varphi(a,b)$$ holds. We would like to have a set $$B$$ of all such $$b$$. We immediately think of using the axiom of separation for this, but what is the set to separate the $$b$$'s from? Since there is no universal set:

> **Theorem** There is no set $$U$$ such that if $$a$$ is a set then $$a\in U$$.
> **Proof** Suppose we had such a $$U$$. Then let us use Separation to define the set $$R = \{x\in U : x\not \in x\}$$. We get Russel's paradox again by asking ourselves whether $$U\in U$$ or not.

We cannot use any of the preceding axioms to construct the desired $$B$$. But we would like to have a function $$f:D_A\rightarrow B$$, where the domain $$D_A = \{x\in A:$$ *Exists* $$y$$ $$\varphi(x,y)\}$$ can be separated from any set $$A$$.

The replacement axiom assumes that we can do it. Like the separation axiom, it is a schema axiom over all wff.'s $$\varphi$$.

> *For all* $$A$$ *Exists* $$B$$ *For all* $$b\inB$$ *Exists* $$x\in A$$ $$\varphi(x,b)$$
