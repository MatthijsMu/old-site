# An Overview of the blogs on Set Theory, Numbers and Logic

This post is intended to give you an overview of the Set Theory blog, the Numbers blog and the Logic blog on this website. These blogs are intended to be read in an approximately linear fashion, starting from Set Theory, through Number Theory to Logic. I based these blogs on the following material:

 - Set Theory: based on lecture notes of Klaas Landsman, [*Introduction to Mathematics*](https://www.math.ru.nl/~landsman/InleidingWiskunde2017.pdf), as well as Garling's [*A Course in Mathematical Analysis, Volume I*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/course-in-mathematical-analysis/C0D89CA72FF3ED2B7F3280A922CF9D5B), Part 1, Chapter 1.

 - Numbers:  based on *Introduction to Mathematics* and Garling's A Course in Mathematical Analysis, Volume I, Part1, Chapter 2.

 - Logic: based on [*Sets, Models and Proofs*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-92414-4).

These books were used in the first-semester course Introduction to Mathematics and the 4th-semester course Logic taught at Radboud University. They inspired me to write a blog, because the rigorous development of sets, functions, number systems, etcetera, is in many ways highly nontrivial and subtle, especially when dealing with infinite sets. The Logic blog is in some sense a natural continuation of rigorous set theory, but can also be read as a separate blog on formal logic (i.e. proofs and model theory). It does however also require an informal development of sets to start with, and the number systems discussed in Numbers will certainly provide us with some interesting models for various theories.

## Sets 

This blog starts with an axiomatic definition of sets. It will then continue to explore set theory, diving into relations, including orders, equivalences and functions. Once functions have entered the play, we introduce the axiom of choice and various equivalent axioms, and study their equivalence using the theory of well-orders.

When defining sets, the aim is not to explain "what" a set is, but rather to specify the axioms according to which sets behave. The notion of a set is simply too abstract to describe intuitively, moreover if we want to do rigorous mathematics with them then the last thing we want is only an intuitive notion: we need the laws according to which the object behaves to make rigorous derivations of other properties.

## Logic

This separation between intuition and formalism will be taken a step further when we will discuss logic. In first order logic, we study theories, which are sets of logical sentences, another mathematical object, in two ways: one way is to interpret the sentences using a model, that is, we define what it means for a sentence to hold in a structure and if a structure satisfies all sentences of the theory, it "models" the sentence. This is a good way to create an intuition of the objects that are described by the theory. The other way of studying theories looks not at interpretations of sentences but at rules for recombining logical sentences into new logical sentences. The recombination leads us to definitions such as proof trees and ultimately to the notion of a formal "proof" of a "theorem".

If you have not seen mathematical logic yet, be aware that these proofs are different from a proof using natural language that is usual in mathematics texts. Formal proofs in logic are mathematical objects that we can again prove properties/theorems about in natural language. In a sense, we study the way we prove and reason about mathematical things from a meta-level.

## Numbers

Even though logic studies mathematical reasoning at the lowest possible level of abstraction, a rigorous course in model theory and proof trees is usually only given in the second year of a mathematics B.S. The reason is that students should be familiar with theories such as those of the natural, integer, rational and real numbers before being exposed to formal theories and models for them. These number systems are the focus of Numbers. I highly recommend reading this blog secondly, before continuing to Logic. The real number system will also provide the foundations for Mathematical Analysis (which is, not coincidentally, the actual subject of Garling's book), which I might discuss in a later blog.

## Further Studies

The theory of rings, groups, fields and ordered fields in these posts is only developed for the integer, rational and real number systems, Much more can be said about these theories in, say, the courses at Radboud such as Group Theory and Rings and Fields. It is unfortunate. If you do like to know, you should consider studying mathematics (advertising intended)!
