I am a BS student in Mathematics and Computer Science at [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/en), Nijmegen. My interests are complexity and algorithms, statistics, physics, but I'm also into abstract algebra. Currently, I would like to get involved in research, whether it be theoretical or applied.

Previously, my mathematical interests lead me to participate in the [Dutch Mathematical Olympiad](https://wiskundeolympiade.nl/docenten/info-in-english) (2021) where I placed 16th nationwide. My interest in mathematical modelling led to a project on optimizing blackjack strategies using Reinforcement learning. For this, I was awarded the first prize in the [OMO-PWS-Contest](https://www.omojaarverslag.nl/verslag2022/f/omoprijzen/omoprijzen-een-bijzondere-motiveringsprijs-voor-leerlingen) (2022).

This personal web page features an overview of my academic portfolio: it includes a blog on mathematics, statistics, physics and computer science, and in the future also projects and papers I wrote for myself or for university courses. 


<!--- I may later include some of the teaching I have done. Its purpose is to create interesting reading for fellow students, while conveniently putting into practice my own knowledge and skills.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
