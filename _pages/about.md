I am a BS student in Mathematics and Computer Science at [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/en), Nijmegen. My interests are still very broad: I have done electives in combinatorial group theory, linear programming, quantum mechanics and machine learning. Currently, I would like to get involved in research, whether it be theoretical or applied.

Previously, my mathematical interests lead me to participate in the [Dutch Mathematical Olympiad](https://wiskundeolympiade.nl/docenten/info-in-english) (2021) where I placed 16th nationwide. My interest in mathematical modelling led to a project on optimizing blackjack strategies using Reinforcement learning. For this, I was awarded the first prize in the [OMO-PWS-Contest](https://www.omojaarverslag.nl/verslag2022/f/omoprijzen/omoprijzen-een-bijzondere-motiveringsprijs-voor-leerlingen) (2022). This summer (2023), I participated in the [Cornell, Maryland, Max Planck Pre-doctoral Research School](https://cmmrs.mpi-sws.org/) where I got to meet many amazing cs students and researchers from all over the world, and got to follow lectures on their current research.

This personal web page gives an overview of my academic portfolio. It has a personal blog where I mostly share summaries of courses that I like. And on the `Projects` page, you can find an overview of projects that I have been working on, either for university courses or as a personal interest. 

Finally, I enjoy drawing and painting in my spare time. Some of my favourite results can be found under `Art`.
