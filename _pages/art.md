In my spare time, I enjoy drawing in graphite or in coloured pencils, and painting with watercolour, gouache or acrylics (I have only made one acrylic yet, but I would love to do more of it). I have done some pastels and charcoal drawings in the past, but I find these smudging media hard to preserve, so I generally stick to robust media such as watercolour and pencils.
