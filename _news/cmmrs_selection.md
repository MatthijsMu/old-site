I am very fortunate to have been selected for the Cornell, Maryland, Max Planck Pre-Doctoral Research Summer School (CMMRS), hosted at Max Planck Institute for Software Science (Saarbr√ºcken) this summer. I am one of the 100-ish students who were selected from 500+ applications from all around the world. 

The school, aimed at undergraduate and masters students, means a week-long exposure to the wildest, most cutting-edge research in computer science. [Leading researchers](https://cmmrs.mpi-sws.org/lecturer-biographies/) will engage with attendees in their areas of expertise: the curriculum will include lectures and interaction (e.g. mentoring sessions, panel sessions) with faculty from participating institutions (Cornell, Maryland, MPI)

I am excited to meet the fellow attendees, and hope to see many inspiring lectures, have awesome conversations on CS and connect with the inspiring people who expand the frontiers of our current state-of-art. 

I am receiving a travel stipend and fully funded accomodation for the duration of the school, from MPI.
