SO last week I attended the [CMMRS 2023](https://cmmrs.mpi-sws.org/) at MPI-SWS in Saarbr√ºcken. It was a truly amazing experience that I highly recommend to  everyone studying CS and wanting to dive deeper during summer breaks.

The lectures were amazing, as were the lecturers. Their research was inspiring and very surprising. Take for example Tapomayukh ‚ÄúTapo‚Äù Bhattacharjee: he leads the EmPRISE Lab at Cornell, where he extends the current capabilities of robotics to enable robots to assist people with mobility limitations with activities of daily living. Applications that are of huge impact on the daily lives of people, and that may in the next years improve the lives of people in ways we could not even dream of ten years ago.

The conversations with fellow students and faculty I had were amazing. I must admit that I was quite the youngest person in the group, being a almost-second-year BS between advanced undergraduates and graduates, who usually already had research experience while I had none. Yet, if you are really interested, I found that there is no barrier at all! Also, speaking to people who come from all around the world really widens your view and makes you look beyond the borders of your own country and culture.

Finally, Saarbr√ºcken is an amazing city. I thought that I already knew the region, having been to Saarburg for a holiday before. But it turns out that the region is very diverse and that in contrast to Saarburg, Saarbr√ºcken lies in the middle of a forest. It is a very green place with a beautiful park around the river banks. The campus of Saarland University is somewhat higher in the hills, also located in the forest, at a distance of 45 minutes, walking from the city.

For all fellow attendees and faculty reading this, I want to say a big thank you for the incredible time at the Cornell, Maryland, Max-Planck pre-doctoral research school. Wishing you all the best on your PhD journeys and beyond! üéìüåü Let's stay hopeful for future reunions. Until then, keep rocking the world of research!
