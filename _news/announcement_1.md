I am happy to announce the publication of this personal page. Here, I will try to regularly blog about various interesting subjects
from mathematics and computer science, and hopefully inspire you to look into these subjects as well. 

Aside from that, I will use this site to maintain and publish my portfolio and curriculum vitae. There will also be room for 
miscellaneous non-academic occupations, such as:

<ul>
    <li>My drawings;</li>
    <li>Books I have read;</li>
</ul>

I hope you enjoy reading through this website!
