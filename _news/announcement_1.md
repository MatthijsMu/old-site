I am happy to announce the publication of this personal page. Here, I will try to regularly blog about various interesting subjects
from mathematics and computer science, and hopefully inspire you to look into these subjects as well. There will also be room for 
miscellaneous non-academic occupations, such as:

<ul>
    <li>my drawings</li>
    <li>books I have read</li>
</ul>

I hope you enjoy reading through this website!
