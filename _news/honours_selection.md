I am happy to announce that I have been selected for the [Radboud University Honours Programme for Science](https://www.ru.nl/honoursacademy/bachelor/science/)! 

Aimed at outstanding first-year BS students with a curious mind, wanting to get their research career off to a flying start, the Radboud Honours Programme is a two-year programme admitting around 25 students every year. 

Its participants get the opportunity to explore an exciting science topic together with students from other disciplines of the Faculty of Science in their second year, and to turn their Bachelorâ€™s thesis into a scientific masterpiece in the third. 

Concretely, this also means that I can (I am even required to) spend 24 EC on my thesis, and that there is more funding available for doing my thesis at an abroad university. Feel free to reach out to me if your department has open math/cs BS thesis positions aimed advanced undergraduates! I would be happy to collaborate.
